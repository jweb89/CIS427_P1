You will need python 3 to to run the python files

To run the application use the following commands in 2 seperate terminals:

- `python server.py`
- `python client.py 127.0.0.1` (for localhost)

From there you can enter all the commands into the client.py terminal using 1 as the user id for any commands that need it. For more details please see video recording.
